                    <h3>NARUTO SHIPPUDEN</h3>
                    As Naruto was born, his home village of Konoha came under attack by a nine-tailed fox demon which
                    was sealed in him at infancy to protect the people of the village. Due to this fact he became
                    distrusted and resented by the people around him during his childhood. He, however, aspires to
                    become the Hokage; a title given to the leader of Hidden Leaf Village, and as the most poorly
                    performing student in his ninja school, he strives to prove his worth to his peers and fellow
                    villagers. He is known for his often-used catchphrase "Dattebayo", and is connected to most other
                    characters around him by either friendship or rivalry.
